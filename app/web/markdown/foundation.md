In the past, Couchers was supported by the Couchers.org Foundation, an Australian not-for-profit. Due to the narrow and inflexible definition of what a "public charity" is in Australia, that entity never gained such charity status, so it did not receive the benefits of being a charity (such as tax exemption and [many forms of sponsorship by companies](/open-source)). A decision was made to incroporate Couchers, Inc. in the United States in late 2021, and the project was moved under the purview of this new non-profit in early 2022. You can read more about the two non-profit organizations on [the blog post announcing Couchers, Inc.](/blog/2022/01/20/couchers-becomes-501c3-nonprofit).
