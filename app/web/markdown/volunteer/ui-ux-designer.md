## Position Description

**This is a remote volunteer position**

Couchers.org is seeking an experienced UI/UX Designer to help us build and improve upon next-generation, non-profit couch surfing platform. We need help refining and iterating on our existing Figma-based designs for web and mobile platforms. We’re looking for a candidate with substantial experience in ui/ux design of web and/or mobile apps with a modern, minimalist design. Our designs are already well-established, so much of the work will involve iteration and refinement; however, there are also completely new features and partially designed concepts that will benefit from your creative input and ui/ux design skills. We use React and Material UI for our frontend, and some of the tools we use to collaborate are figma, github, slack, and zoom.

This role provides an opportunity to contribute to a 501c3 non-profit, open-source project that fosters meaningful connections around the world. You’ll work closely with frontend developers, design team members, and various other Couchers.org volunteers around the world.

### Duties

- Iterate on and refine existing Figma designs for both web and mobile experiences;
- Design user flows, wireframes, and UI elements for new features as needed;
- Conduct user testing and gather feedback to make data-informed design improvements;
- Ensure all designs align with Couchers.org’s community guidelines for respect, safety, and inclusivity;
- Collaborate with developers to implement design elements that are user-friendly and visually cohesive;
- Adhere to and expand our design system based on Material UI standards.

### Skills & Experience

Ideal candidates will have the following:
- A portfolio showcasing your experience in UI/UX design;
- Proficiency in Figma and experience working within established design systems;
- Understanding of accessibility and usability best practices;
- Strong communication skills in English (C1+) for effective cross-team collaboration;
- Experience using couch surfing platforms (BeWelcome, Couchsurfing™, Trustroots, Workaway, etc) is a big plus but not required.

### Expectations/Commitment

- Able to contribute 5 hours per week (or more)
- 6-month minimum commitment
- This is an unpaid volunteer role. Couchers.org is built and run entirely by dedicated volunteers.

### Apply

1. [Fill out this form](/volunteer/form). Under "Position Applying For", put "UI/UX Designer". Be sure to include a link to your portfolio or examples of your work.

2. We'll review and get back to you as soon as possible — setting up a Zoom call so we can get to know you and you can meet some members of the team.

3. After accepting the position, we'll add you to slack and get you onboarded with the people you're going to directly work with.
