Our docs are divided between the **web frontend** (TypeScript/React) and the **backend** (everything else). To run everything locally, refer to the backend guide which will point you to the right place.

## Frontend

For getting started with the **web frontend**: read [app/web/readme.md](web/readme.md).

## Backend and full stack

For getting started with the **backend**: read [app/backend/readme.md](backend/readme.md).
