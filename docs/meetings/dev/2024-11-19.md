Present: Aapeli, David, Jesse, Justyna, Navi, Nicole, Yannic

# Notes

* Chit chat for a while because a bunch of people were joining late
* David: has a new 1 month gig (maybe longer depending on funding)
  - Will abandon his PR
  - Will still review Mui v5 for Nicole
* Nicole: Material UI v5
  - Aapeli: flickering (presumably) due to SSR differing from client side, will chat with Nicole
* Nicole: planning on doing React upgrade after
* Aapeli: upgraded Postgres to 17.1 from 16: you need to migrate if you run the full backend (easiest is to nuke and restart)
* Aapeli: upgraded prod from Ubuntu 20.04 to 24.04
* Translations
  - Consensus: we should recruit someone to lead it as a standalone project
  - Jesse: will write the volunteer position description
* Forum: what are we doing about it?
  - Jesse: should we close it down? Has it served its purpose?
* Recruiting: let's think about which positions we need to recruit for
* Aapeli: we will set up a conversation with active developers and the board
* Volunteer newsletter
  - With lists of TODOs by category
* Nicole: are we still Beta?
  - Aapeli: it's all about marketing: we wanted to do a big release with lots of fanfare
  - Aapeli: David had a list of pain points he wanted to fix before he sees the platform as "usable"
  - Nicole: some people might be put off by "Beta" and "new"
  - Nicole: maybe we can coordinate with community leaders to time a v1 release with a bunch of local events?
  - Nicole: should we prioritize moving out of Beta?
* Jesse: need an API to remove comments
  - Yannic: happy to work on this
* Yannic: map stuff
* Aapeli: wants to clean up slack and take over #general instead of #active-couchers

* What everyone's working on:
  - Aapeli: upgraded a bunch of stuff, helped with tools/support, thinking about priorities, PRs to merge, working on admin APIs
  - Jesse: support & dealing with troublemakers, private feedback designs
  - Justyna: getting started on things
  - Nicole: finishing material ui v5 upgrade, then react, then next
  - Yannic: working on the user survey, would like to work on API to remove comments
