# Notes

* Discussion on the purpose of the meeting
  - Dev has a good thing going on with meetings, onboarding, community, etc
  - It would be good to have a meeting in a different timezone as well
* What project management tools should we use?
  - Slack has most of what we need, so let's use that
* How to allocate people to work on different tasks given it's a volunteer project and people might be flaky?
  - Aapeli: on the dev side we've found it useful to give people a small task and grow bigger until we figure out their level of commitment/style
  - Gabx: in his experience having clarity on deadlines and tasks helps people figure out their commitment
  - Gabx: we will have various tasks and we just need people with the right experience
  - Jesse: it's also important we have people who have couch surfing experience
  - Gabx: commitment is most important, skill is second most improtant
  - Aapeli: it's the nature of the project that people will be flaky, so we need mechanisms to not waste too much time on them and not be too frustrated
* Rebranding
  - Aapeli: introducing Gabx who will be the team lead, met at Brisbane meetup
  - Gabx: design, social media & content, community champions, devs
  - Hoping to wrap it up by May
  - Jesse: what is the difference between community champions vs current community builders?
* Discussion on using social media platforms for community
  - Gabx: facebook groups and instagram would be great to create buzz and cross-link to the platform
  - Aapeli: the idea of having local communities use local platforms to organize community is core to the original philosophy to Couchers
  - Who is the admin? How would succession work? We would need it to eventually lead back to this team.
  - Jesse: wary of people starting to use these channels for support
* Regular meeting time: 11:30 UTC on Sundays
